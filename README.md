## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection
In this assignment I learned about some of the basics of Onshape. I thought it was difficult sometimes because there are so many things to click that a lot of the time I would select the wrong one and have to rewatch the video and try again. It took me a couple tries to get them right, but here are some of the shortcuts I learned:

* Normal(n)
* Rectangle(r)
* Circle(c)

## Mount

In this assignment I learned how to use the linear pattern button a bit more. It took me a couple tries to get it right because I didn't realize that if I wanted it to pattern down it had to be negative. I used the first example he showed us, but I am going to watch the rest of the video.

### Fork

In this assignment I learned how to use the mirror button! I think that that will be very useful in the future. I also learned about the fillet and chamfer buttons, and reinforced some things I had learned earlier like keyboard shortcuts and adjusting the dimensions.
