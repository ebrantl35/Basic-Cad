## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection
In this assignment I learned about some of the basics of Onshape. I thought it was difficult sometimes because there are so many things to click that a lot of the time I would select the wrong one and have to rewatch the video and try again. It took me a couple tries to get them right, but here are some of the shortcuts I learned:

* Normal(n)
* Rectangle(r)
* Circle(c)

## Mount

### Description
This assignment was to create the caster mount. The caster's dimensions are 120 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick. There are four 5 mm circles place around the edge and one 25 mm circle in dead center.

### Reflection
In this assignment I learned how to use the linear pattern button a bit more. I had trouble with the linear pattern button because I didn't realize that if I wanted it to pattern down it needed to be negative. I used the first example he showed us, but I am going to watch the rest of the video.

## Fork

### Description
This assignment was to make the caster's fork. The fork has a base of an 80 mm circle 8 mm thick, and has two filleted 40 mm x 15 mm rectanges extruded 75 mm each with a 10 mm circle in them. There is a 20 mm wide hollow cylinder extruded 60 mm.

### Reflection
In this assignment I learned how to use the mirror button! I think that that will be very useful in the future. I also learned about the fillet and chamfer buttons, and reinforced some things I had learned earlier like keyboard shortcuts and adjusting the dimensions. The fillet and chamfer buttons are very similar, but fillet has more of a rounded edge to it than the chamfer.
