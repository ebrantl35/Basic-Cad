## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection
In this assignment I learned about some of the basics of Onshape. I thought it was difficult sometimes because there are so many things to click that a lot of the time I would select the wrong one and have to rewatch the video and try again. It took me a couple tries to get them right, but here are some of the shortcuts I learned:

* Normal(n)
* Rectangle(r)
* Circle(c)

## Mount

### Description
This assignment was to create the caster mount. The caster's dimensions are 120 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick. There are four 5 mm circles place around the edge and one 25 mm circle in dead center.

### Reflection
In this assignment I learned how to use the linear pattern button a bit more. I had trouble with the linear pattern button because I didn't realize that if I wanted it to pattern down it needed to be negative. I used the first example he showed us, but I am going to watch the rest of the video.

## Fork

### Description
This assignment was to make the caster's fork. The fork has a base of an 80 mm circle 8 mm thick, and has two filleted 40 mm x 15 mm rectanges extruded 75 mm each with a 10 mm circle in them. There is a 20 mm wide hollow cylinder extruded 60 mm.

### Reflection
In this assignment I learned how to use the mirror button! I think that that will be very useful in the future. I also learned about the fillet and chamfer buttons, and reinforced some things I had learned earlier like keyboard shortcuts and adjusting the dimensions. The fillet and chamfer buttons are very similar, but fillet has more of a rounded edge to it than the chamfer.

## Tire

### Description
This assignment was to make the caster's tire. There was a trapezoid with a base of 20 mm and sides that were at an angle of 10 degrees away from the center line. Its top line was 110 mm away from the center line, and its bottom line was 80 mm away from the center line. It has an 8 mm fillet on the top edges.

### Reflection
This assignment was exciting! It was the first one where we had to do some figuring out of the steps on our own. I failed spectacularly in this area; I couldn't even figure out how to make the trapezoid without help! But, after watching the video, I was able to go back though the steps with a better understanding, and I feel confident that I will be able to work with less help from the video when I go to make the wheel. I would say that the hardest part of this was understanding what it meant by radius and diameter. I was trying to picture it in 3D instead of on a flat surface, so I was really confused for a couple minutes. I also have no idea what the point of the trapezoid was, but I guess I will find out when we put the caster together.
