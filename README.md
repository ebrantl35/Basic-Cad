## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection
In this assignment I learned about some of the basics of Onshape. I thought it was difficult sometimes because there are so many things to click that a lot of the time I would select the wrong one and have to rewatch the video and try again. It took me a couple tries to get them right, but here are some of the shortcuts I learned:

* Normal(n)
* Rectangle(r)
* Circle(c)

## Mount

### Description
This assignment was to create the caster mount. The caster's dimensions are 120 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick. There are four 5 mm circles place around the edge and one 25 mm circle in dead center.

### Reflection
In this assignment I learned how to use the linear pattern button a bit more. I had trouble with the linear pattern button because I didn't realize that if I wanted it to pattern down it needed to be negative. I used the first example he showed us, but I am going to watch the rest of the video.

## Fork

### Description
This assignment was to make the caster's fork. The fork has a base of an 80 mm circle 8 mm thick, and has two filleted 40 mm x 15 mm rectanges extruded 75 mm each with a 10 mm circle in them. There is a 20 mm wide hollow cylinder extruded 60 mm.

### Reflection
In this assignment I learned how to use the mirror button! I think that that will be very useful in the future. I also learned about the fillet and chamfer buttons, and reinforced some things I had learned earlier like keyboard shortcuts and adjusting the dimensions. The fillet and chamfer buttons are very similar, but fillet has more of a rounded edge to it than the chamfer.

## Tire

### Description
This assignment was to make the caster's tire. There was a trapezoid with a base of 20 mm and sides that were at an angle of 10 degrees away from the center line. Its top line was 110 mm away from the center line, and its bottom line was 80 mm away from the center line. It has an 8 mm fillet on the top edges.

### Reflection
This assignment was exciting! It was the first one where we had to do some figuring out of the steps on our own. I failed spectacularly in this area; I couldn't even figure out how to make the trapezoid without help! But, after watching the video, I was able to go back though the steps with a better understanding, and I feel confident that I will be able to work with less help from the video when I go to make the wheel. I would say that the hardest part of this was understanding what it meant by radius and diameter. I was trying to picture it in 3D instead of on a flat surface, so I was really confused for a couple minutes. I also have no idea what the point of the trapezoid was, but I guess I will find out when we put the caster together.

## Wheel

### Description
The wheel was made of three rectangles that got stacked on top of each other and then revolved. Then we made the sections between the spokes and removed them. These were made with center point arcs that had radii of 18 and 30 and angles of 60 degrees. There was a 4 mm interior fillet and an entire 1 mm face fillet. The extrusion was patterned in a circle five times.

### Reflection
In this assignment, I was very determined to figure it out without the video. Everything was fine until the cutout step. I went ahead and did all that I could, but was stumped on how to make degrees. So when I went into the video, I was surprised to find out that that was step one! I didn't want to have to redo everything, so I just made those lines and the lines I had drawn coincedent and I didn't have to redo everything which was nice. I also had a bit of trouble with the revolve feature on the first one because my wheel ended up perpendicular to my tire! Luckily, I realized I could just change the sketch face and transfer my wheel- I was about to delete it and start over on a new plane! But then, something looked off and so to be safe I redid everything and carried on, only to find at the end my cutouts were too long and the fillets were touching each other! I went back in and saw that something had gone wrong with my angle and it was at 73 instead of 60. I fixed that, and finally everything looked good.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description
In this assignment, we made a hollow tube with two little semicircles shaved off the top for the axle, then added a 5 mm collar. We then extruded a circle through the collar but chose the merge to be the collar, so it only went through the top of it, not to tube. We made bearings too, which were literally just 5 mm thick washers.

### Reflection
In this assignment, I really liked using the "use" button! We were able to select lines from different parts to use in new sketches! It is so much easier than having to make all of those construction lines! I also got more comfortable with using the extrude tool. I have a better understanding of what the different things at the top mean, and I know how to use the merge scope, which is very exciting! The first time I correctly used it, I wasn't looking at the video, so I thought I had actually done something wrong since it didn't go all the way through.
