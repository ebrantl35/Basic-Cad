In this assignment I learned about some of the basics of Onshape. I thought it was difficult sometimes because there are so many things to click that a lot of the time I would select the wrong one and have to rewatch the video and try again.

In this assignment I learned how to use the linear pattern button a bit more. It took me a couple tries to get it right because I didn't realize that if I wanted it to pattern down it had to be negative. I used the first example he showed us, but I am going to watch the rest of the video.
